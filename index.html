      <h2>What can you do to help?</h2>
      <p>
          We propose an incentivized and centralized yard waste collection system that will solve the current yard waste problem in Chicago.
          You will have an option to dispose of your yard waste or composte it yourself and we will tell you how to do it all!

            <h2>Why is this a problem?</h2>
            <p>
                Dumping yard waste in landfills is both an illegal and expensive process. It costs time and money to improperly dispose
                of yard waste that take up unnecessary space in landfills designated for non-organic waste materials. 
                On top of this, when yard waste breaks down, it turns into the chemical methane; methane emissions pollute the soil and 
                act as a catalyst for the release of other toxins and carcinogens to further destroy the surrounding environment. 
                If Chicago does not act quickly, the city will be in harmâ€™s way when this mountainous yard waste problem comes crashing down.
            </p>
                <p>Proper yard waste disposal can have numerous benefits for not only the city of Chicago and its residents, but also for the environment. 
                        When yard waste is properly diverted from landfills, it can be reused and transformed into compost, mulch, soil, 
                        and other natural products. Our program will seek to reduce and reverse the effects caused improper yard waste disposal 
                        and promote proper landfill diversion so that the city may prosper. </p> 
                        
            <p>Currently, Chicago's landfill diversion doesn't look good compared to other major cities.</p>
